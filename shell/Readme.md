## myShell.py

This shell accepts the folling commands:

- <file/command>
- <file/command> > <outputFile>
- <outputFile> < <file/command>
- <file/command> | <file/command>
- export PS1 = "<newPromp>"
- exit (To close myShell.py)

I work together with Stephanie Loya. We both developed the logic and structure of the code.
